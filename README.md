# Environment Switcher Application

This extension is useful when working on a project with multiple environments (dev, staging, production, â€¦), it can be interesting to have the possibility to switch from a wiki page in production to the same exact page in dev, or on staging. The app adds a UIX that allows switching from one instance to another.
